**🚀 PySpark Learning Journey — Manikandan**

Welcome to my PySpark Learning Journey repository!
This repo documents my hands-on practice, daily exercises, use-cases, and end-to-end data engineering scenarios using PySpark, SQL, and big-data concepts.

My goal is to build strong, interview-ready skills in PySpark and Data Engineering.

**📘 What This Repository Contains**

✅ 1. **Daily PySpark Coding Practice**

Transformations & Actions

Joins, Aggregations, Window functions

Date & Time functions

Handling nulls, duplicates, and data quality rules

UDFs, performance tuning basics

✅ 2. **Scenario-Based Real DE Problems**

Every folder includes real interview-style questions such as:

Detecting missing dates

Identifying duplicates

SCD & CDC handling

Data quality validation

Skew handling

Partitioning & performance tuning

✅ 3. **End-to-End Mini Projects**

Practical PySpark pipelines:

Reading from CSV/JSON/Parquet

Applying business rules

Writing optimized output

Partitioning, bucketing, and caching

Sample Airflow DAGs for orchestration

✅ 4. **SQL + PySpark Equivalent Solutions**

Side-by-side comparison:

SQL queries

PySpark DataFrame solutions

Window functions

Optimization tips
